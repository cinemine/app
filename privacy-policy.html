                            <u>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights</u><br/><br/>
                            We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.<br/><br/>
                            <u>Verification process</u><br/><br/>
                            Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.<br/><br/>
                            We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.<br/><br/>
                            <u>Other privacy rights</u><br/><br/>
                            • you may object to the processing of your personal data<br/><br/>
                            • you may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the data<br/><br/>
                            • you can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.<br/><br/>
                            • you may request to opt-out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving a request to opt-out, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than 15 days from the date of the request submission.<br/><br/>
                            To exercise these rights, you can contact us by email at cineminedeveloper@gmail.com, or by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document. If you have a complaint about how we handle your data, we would like to hear from you.
